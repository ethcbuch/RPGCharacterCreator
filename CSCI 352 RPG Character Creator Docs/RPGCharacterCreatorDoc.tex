\section{Introduction}



Character creation is a very important part of any RPG experience. The RPG Character Creator is designed to provide an easy way to plan out future RPG journeys, whether you are an experienced RPG veteran or new to the RPG genre, the RPG Character Creator will provide a fun and engaging way to customize certain aspects of your character.While it is not necessary to plan out your character in advance, doing so allows stronger, more focused characters that can make your experience playing through the game better. While we can't provide a RPG character creator that covers every RPG system, we do hope our more generalized system allows the user to create a character that covers many different games.

\subsection{Background}
If you are unfamiliar with the RPG (Role-Playing Game) genre, there are a few things you should know. Firstly, RPGs allow you to play the role of a fictional character in a narrative-driven story. You are then given the ability to create and customize you character choosing who and what you want to play as. Some different attributes that you might be able to customize would include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Name
\item Appearance.
\item Class
\item Race
\item Background
\item Skills and Abilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Impacts}
While this project might not be impactful to everyone,we hope that the RPG Character Creator will have a major impact with people who enjoy playing RPG games. It would allow for users to plan out their character for their next RPG journey, which can enhance their overall experience.

\subsection{Challenges}
A few challenges that we anticipate through the course of this project include:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Not being that acquainted with WPF Applications enough to do implement functionality.
\item Creating a GUI that makes it easy for the user to navigate through.
\item “Broken windows” in our code.
\item Being able to finish the project on time.
\end{itemize}

A way we would overcome these challenges is by following the stages in the waterfall software development life cycle (SDLC). The SDLC makes sure that as we progress through the different phases of this project we keep in mind what has to be accomplished in order to move forward to the next stage.



\section{Scope}
The completion of the project would mean that the user can create a single or multiple RPG characters by customizing the characters Name, Class, Attributes, Stats and much more.
The RPG Character Creator would show the list of characters that have been created allowing for the creation/deletion of characters and even modifying characters after they have been created.
A few stretch goals we have include:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Different rule sets for different types of RPGs (example: Fallout/ DnD 5e)
\item Allow for the user to toggle a DM mode which allows them to add custom skills, abilities, races, and  classes to the character creator allowing for more customization of characters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements}
We want to make sure that our project meets the user's needs, so we looked at similar RPG character creator websites and looked at a variety of different video game character creators to understand what is required to create a fulfilling character creator that does not make the user want for more customization. We found that users prefer something that's easy to use, responsive, and gives the user many different options. Based on what we found users preferred, we created these requirements for our application.

\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user should be able to create a new character.
\item The user should be able to customize their character's stats, skills, abilities, choose from a large list of classes, choose from a wide variety of different races, and their character's background
\item The user should be able to manage their characters by viewing, editing, and deleting them
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application should be easy to use allowing the user to easily navigate through the GUI making it a more pleasant experience.
\item Users will be able to use RPG Character creator without it feeling choppy or unresponsive.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Timeline}
\textbf{Project Proposal Draft (February 04, 2023)} - First, we brainstormed ideas for a project that would be worth pursuing, and then we drafted a project proposal. This proposal included a project name, an abstract, an introduction, and a scope. Finally, we created a Github repository and uploaded the proposal to it.
\\[10pt]
\textbf{Project Proposal Update (February 28, 2023)} - The update to the project proposal involved identifying the use cases for the project, as well as defining its functional and non-functional requirements. In addition, several interface mockups were created to show our vision for the project.
\\[10pt]
\textbf{GUI Day (March 9th, 2023)}  - Showcased our interface mockups to the class and gathered feedback on potential additions or modifications to our interface mockups.
\\[10pt]
Coding of the actual project began during these two periods beginning with the implementation of a basic UI and building upon it leading up to demo day.
\\[10pt]
\textbf{Demo Day (April 6th, 2023)} - Presented the current status of our project to our classmates and Dr. Ericson.
\\[10pt]
\textbf{Project Update (April 10th, 2023)} - We created a timeline to showcase the progression we have made so far, which involved adding project structure and outlining UML diagrams to project documentation.
\\[10pt]
\textbf{Penultimate Writeup(April 21, 2023)} - We plan to revisit our work and make necessary updates to our documentation to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date by the specified time.
\\[10pt]
\textbf{Presentation Draft (April 21, 2023)} - We plan on presenting our slides, and giving a small demo of our current project to receive feedback before our final presentation.
\\[10pt]
\textbf{Final presentation(April 29, 2023)} - We plan on finishing our project and giving our final presentation to the class.
\\[10pt]
\textbf{Final Written Report (April 28, 203)} - We plan on having our final written report that will contain all needed information to show what we have accomplished.

\section{Project Structure}
	First, we needed to determine our target audience. In our case, we decided that this RPG character creator would be geared towards everyone, including both experienced and beginner RPG players. We wanted to make the process as smooth as possible for the user, so we decided on having an easy-to-navigate user interface. We designed the RPG character creator with several sections, including Character which includes the basic character information such as name, age, birthday, and gender. There is also a portrait section where users can choose from pre-selected images or upload their own. The race, background, and alignment section allows users to choose from multiple options, and their information is filled in accordingly. There is also a stats and skills section and an overview page that lets users review their character's details before finalizing the creation process.
	
	In order to stay organized throughout the development stage, we have decided to implement the builder design pattern in our RPG character creator application. By using this pattern, we can easily create complex objects (Characters in our case) by building them step by step. The builder pattern offers the advantage of creating multiple types of objects using the same interface, which will be helpful for our application since users can create a variety of RPG characters.We also implemented the abstract factory design pattern which will be used to create different color themes for the application, easily allowing user to switch between different themes without affecting the functionality or structure of the application.
	
In addition to the design patterns, we have also implemented the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture in our RPG character creator application. MVVM helps to cleanly separate the GUI and program logic allowing for better maintainability and testability.

\subsection{UML Outline}
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[scale=0.19]{RPGCharacterCreatorUML.png}
\caption{The entire UML for the project}
\label{fullUML}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{factMethod.png}
\caption{Possible implementation for a factory method that allows for us to easily change the theme of the UI.}
\label{themeFact}
\end{figure}

The following UML is an Abstract Factory Design pattern see Figure \ref{themeFact}

The BackgroundFactory is an abstract class that defines a factory method, ‘CreateBackground()’ , which returns a Background object.

The LightTheme and DarkTheme classes are concrete implementations of the BackgroundFactory class. Each class provides a different implementation of the CreateBackground() method, which creates a Background object that has a different color theme.

The Background class is a product of the BackgroundFactory class. It defines a set of properties and methods that allow clients to interact with the background object, such as getting and setting the background color.

Clients of the BackgroundFactory pattern use the factory method to create a Background object without having to know the implementation details of the factory or the product.
\\[10pt]
The following UML is a Builder Design pattern see Figure \ref{charAndBuilder}.

The CharacterBuilder interface specifies the steps for building a character. 

The GeneralCharacterBuilder class implements this interface and is responsible for building the character. 

The CharacterDirector class instructs the GeneralCharacterBuilder on the steps to building a character.
 The GeneralCharacter object is the complex object, and the CharacterBuilder interface defines the steps required to construct it. 

The GeneralCharacterBuilder class implements these steps in its methods.

The CharacterDirector class acts as a director, which looks over  the construction process and can create a specific type of character by using a specific implementation of the CharacterBuilder interface.



\begin{figure}[ht!]

\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
Make sure to actually use at least 2 design patterns from this class.  This is not normally part of such documentation, but largely just specific to this class -- I want to see you use the patterns!


\section{Results}
This section will start out a little vague, but it should grow as your project evolves.  With each deliverable you hand in, give me a final summary of where your project stands.  By the end, this should be a reflective section discussing how many of your original goals you managed to attain/how many desired use cases you implemented/how many extra features you added.

\subsection{Future Work}
Where are you going next with your project?
For early deliverables, what are your next steps?  (HINT: you will typically want to look back at your timeline and evaluate: did you meet your expected goals?  Are you ahead of schedule?  Did you decide to shift gears and implement a new feature?)
By the end, what do you plan on doing with this project?  Will you try to sell it?  Set it on fire?  Link to it on your resume and forget it exists?
