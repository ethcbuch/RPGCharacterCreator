\section{Introduction}



Character creation is a very important part of any RPG experience. The RPG Character Creator is designed to provide an easy way to plan out future RPG journeys, whether you are an experienced RPG veteran or new to the RPG genre, the RPG Character Creator will provide a fun and engaging way to customize certain aspects of your character.While it is not necessary to plan out your character in advance, doing so allows stronger, more focused characters that can make your experience playing through the game better. While we can't provide a RPG character creator that covers every RPG system, we do hope our more generalized system allows the user to create a character that covers many different games.

\subsection{Background}
If you are unfamiliar with the RPG (Role-Playing Game) genre, there are a few things you should know. Firstly, RPGs allow you to play the role of a fictional character in a narrative-driven story. You are then given the ability to create and customize you character choosing who and what you want to play as. Some different attributes that you might be able to customize would include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Name
\item Appearance.
\item Class
\item Race
\item Background
\item Skills and Abilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Impacts}
While this project might not be impactful to everyone,we hope that the RPG Character Creator will have a major impact with people who enjoy playing RPG games. It would allow for users to plan out their character for their next RPG journey, which can enhance their overall experience.

\subsection{Challenges}
A few challenges that we anticipate through the course of this project include:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Not being that acquainted with WPF Applications enough to do implement functionality.
\item Creating a GUI that makes it easy for the user to navigate through.
\item “Broken windows” in our code.
\item Being able to finish the project on time.
\end{itemize}

A way we would overcome these challenges is by following the stages in the waterfall software development life cycle (SDLC). The SDLC makes sure that as we progress through the different phases of this project we keep in mind what has to be accomplished in order to move forward to the next stage.



\section{Scope}
The completion of the project would mean that the user can create a single or multiple RPG characters by customizing the characters Name, Class, Attributes, Stats and much more.
The RPG Character Creator would show the list of characters that have been created allowing for the creation/deletion of characters and even modifying characters after they have been created.
A few stretch goals we have include:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Different rule sets for different types of RPGs (example: Fallout/ DnD 5e)
\item Allow for the user to toggle a DM mode which allows them to add custom skills, abilities, races, and  classes to the character creator allowing for more customization of characters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements}
We want to make sure that our project meets the user's needs, so we looked at similar RPG character creator websites and looked at a variety of different video game character creators to understand what is required to create a fulfilling character creator that does not make the user want for more customization. We found that users prefer something that's easy to use, responsive, and gives the user many different options. Based on what we found users preferred, we created these requirements for our application.

\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user should be able to create a new character.
\item The user should be able to customize their character's stats, skills, abilities, choose from a large list of classes, choose from a wide variety of different races, and their character's background
\item The user should be able to manage their characters by viewing, editing, and deleting them
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item The application should be easy to use allowing the user to easily navigate through the GUI making it a more pleasant experience.
\item Users will be able to use  RPG Character creator without it feeling choppy or unresponsive.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Timeline}
Go back to your notes and look up a typical project development life cycle for the Waterfall approach.  How will you follow this life cycle over the remainder of this semester?  This will usually involve a chart showing your proposed timeline, with specific milestones plotted out.  Make sure you have deliverable dates from the course schedule listed, with a plan to meet them (NOTE: these are generally optimistic deadlines).

\section{Project Structure}
At first, this will be a little empty (it will need to be filled in by the time you turn in your final report).  This is your chance to discuss all of your design decisions (consider this the README's big brother).

\subsection{UML Outline}
Show the full structure of your program.  Make sure to keep on updating this section as your project evolves (you often start out with one plan, but end up modifying things as you move along).  As a note, while Dia fails miserably at generating pdfs (probably my fault), I have had much success with png files.  Make sure to wrap your images in a \texttt{figure} environment, and to reference with the \texttt{ref} command.  For example, see Figure \ref{cat2}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{cat2.jpg}
\caption{Your figures should be in the \emph{figure} environment, and have captions.  Should also be of diagrams pertaining to your project, not random internet kittens}
\label{cat2}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
Make sure to actually use at least 2 design patterns from this class.  This is not normally part of such documentation, but largely just specific to this class -- I want to see you use the patterns!


\section{Results}
This section will start out a little vague, but it should grow as your project evolves.  With each deliverable you hand in, give me a final summary of where your project stands.  By the end, this should be a reflective section discussing how many of your original goals you managed to attain/how many desired use cases you implemented/how many extra features you added.

\subsection{Future Work}
Where are you going next with your project?
For early deliverables, what are your next steps?  (HINT: you will typically want to look back at your timeline and evaluate: did you meet your expected goals?  Are you ahead of schedule?  Did you decide to shift gears and implement a new feature?)
By the end, what do you plan on doing with this project?  Will you try to sell it?  Set it on fire?  Link to it on your resume and forget it exists?
